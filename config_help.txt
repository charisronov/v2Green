CHANGE MENU IN DISPLAY CONTROLER


You can override anything in the menu structure from your printer.cfg. It's described in the documentation here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#menu
. The default menu layout is defined here: https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/klippy/extras/display/menu.cfg
, but you can't alter it by changing that file, you need to override it in the main printer.cfg.

I should be able to add a command to the main menu right? It would be nice to be able to quickly call my cancel print macro.
Jup, entirely possible.
